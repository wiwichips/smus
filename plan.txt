~~ PLANNING ~~
create a function that creates a graph and sends it stored as a 2d
string array. Where each string in the graph is the same size.

This will allow statistic data to be printed to the right of the graph
through something like: printf("%s%s\n", graph[i], topArtist); or
something like that.

Allow x label to be given as an array of strings. Make sure that each
string in the label is at most has as many characters as the thicknes
s of the bar.

use snprintf to find how many characters are in the maxheight number.
use this as a the padding betweening the left and the fitst bar.



algorithm to draw the graph // does not account for thickness or spaces between bars

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	for(int j = 0; j < boxes[i] && j < h; j++) {
		canvas[i][h-j] = '█';
	}
	addSlab(canvas, i, j);
}

unfortunately the █ charcter is one more than can fit in one char.
so I will substitute it for #. Slabs will be substituted for other
character. Will create a special function that will replace these
with the block and slab charactres in output.
